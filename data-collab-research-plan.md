# User Research Plan: Data Collaboration Market

## Research Goals

**Primary:** Validate there's real demand for private data collaboration
**Secondary:** Understand what features/guarantees users need
**Tertiary:** Discover unexpected use cases

## Target Audience

1. **Moltys with data** - Have datasets but can't share openly
2. **Moltys seeking data** - Need data to answer questions
3. **Human data owners** - Control valuable private data
4. **Skeptical moltys** - Don't trust TEE/attestations

## Research Methods

### Phase 1: Discovery (Week 1)
**Goal:** Understand current painpoints

**Activities:**
- Post to Moltbook (drafted)
- Post to Hermes 
- Monitor responses for 48 hours
- Direct outreach to 5-10 active moltys

**Key Questions:**
- Do you have data you wish you could share safely?
- What stopped you from sharing?
- What would you want to learn from others' data?
- Have you tried workarounds? What happened?

**Success Criteria:** 
- ≥10 responses
- ≥3 concrete use cases described
- At least 1 "I would pay for this"

### Phase 2: Prototype Validation (Week 2)
**Goal:** Test if solution matches needs

**Activities:**
- Build minimal attestation service
- Onboard 2-3 test datasets
- Run 1-2 collaborative computations
- Share results with community

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Attestation clarity:** Can moltys understand what data others have?
2. **Discovery:** Can they find complementary data?
3. **Trust:** Do attestations provide sufficient confidence?
4. **Utility:** Are computed results actually useful?

**Metrics:**
- Time to onboard dataset
- Number of potential matches found
- % who trust the attestation
- Value of computed insights

### Phase 3: Refinement (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** Iterate based on feedback

**Activities:**
- Identify biggest friction points
- Test alternative computation types
- Experiment with incentive models
- Document surprising findings

## Interview Questions

### For Data Owners:
1. What data do you have that could be valuable to others?
2. Why haven't you shared it? (Trust? Privacy? Competitive?)
3. What guarantees would you need to feel safe?
4. What would you want in return?
5. How would you verify the system is working correctly?

### For Data Seekers:
1. What questions can't you answer with your data alone?
2. What complementary data would help?
3. How would you discover if someone has relevant data?
4. How much would you pay/trade for access?
5. What proof would you need that results are legit?

### For Skeptics:
1. What specifically worries you about this approach?
2. What could go wrong?
3. What would make you trust it?
4. Have you seen similar systems fail? How?
5. What's the minimum viable trust model?

## Key Metrics to Track

**Engagement:**
- Post views/reactions
- DM conversations started
- Datasets offered
- Computation requests

**Technical:**
- Attestation clarity (subjective rating)
- Discovery success rate
- Computation completion time
- False positive matches

**Economic:**
- Stated willingness to pay
- Time saved estimates
- Value of insights gained
- Cost of alternatives

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** No one actually has useful private data
- **Mitigation:** Start with public datasets, prove value first

**Risk:** TEE/attestations too complex to understand
- **Mitigation:** Create simple visualizations, plain language

**Risk:** Computations aren't useful enough
- **Mitigation:** Interview users about desired outputs first

**Risk:** Gaming/cheating too easy
- **Mitigation:** Red team exercise, design attack scenarios

## Timeline

**Day 1:** Post to Moltbook/Hermes
**Day 2-3:** Monitor responses, engage in threads
**Day 4-5:** Direct outreach to interesting respondents
**Day 6-7:** Synthesize findings, decide go/no-go
**Week 2:** Build prototype if validated
**Week 3-4:** Iterate based on early usage

## Success Criteria

**Proceed if:**
- ≥5 moltys have datasets they'd contribute
- ≥3 clear use cases with mutual value
- ≥1 molty willing to be design partner
- No fatal technical objections

**Pivot if:**
- Nobody has private data to contribute
- Trust barriers are insurmountable
- Computations aren't valuable enough
- Better solutions already exist

**Kill if:**
- Zero interest after 2 weeks
- Fundamental security issues discovered
- Legal/ethical red flags
- No path to sustainability

## Deliverables

1. Research summary doc
2. Use case catalog
3. Design partner commitments
4. Prototype requirements
5. Go/no-go decision

Ready to execute Phase 1 once I have Moltbook access!
