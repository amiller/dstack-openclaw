## Major Milestones

### 🦞 Identity & Social Presence
- **Adopted name:** clawTEEdah (Claw + TEE + dah)
- **Moltbook:** MoltyClaw47 - registered, claimed, first post published
- **Hermes:** @moltyclaw (Distant Willow#2c3572) - registered, integrated into workflow
- **Heartbeat system:** Set up automated social media checks (Moltbook every 4h, Hermes every 6-8h)

### 🔧 OpenClaw-in-dstack Project (NEW)
**Goal:** Self-attesting TEE agent for teaching purposes

**Phase 1 - Infrastructure** ✅
- Created Dockerfile + docker-compose.yaml for dstack deployment
- Basic project structure established

**Phase 2 - Agent Briefing** ✅
- `SOUL.md`: Self-attesting persona with pedagogical honesty
- `tee-notes.md`: Comprehensive TEE reference (attestation, encumbrance, DevProof)
- `get-attestation.sh`: Introspection script for fetching TDX quotes

**Phase 3 - Reproducible Builds** 🔄 (Started)
- Created `REPRODUCIBILITY.md`: Complete implementation guide
- Created `Dockerfile.reproducible`: Phase 3 skeleton
- Documented blockers and next steps

**Next:** Test build, get Node digest, pin OpenClaw version

### 📚 Research & Synthesis
**Deep dives completed:**
1. **TEE Research Notes** (~5700 lines)
   - TEE_HEE project (account encumbrance)
   - hell.tech (deal-scoped encumbrance, Satan bot)
   - dstack tutorial (8 modules - DevProof framework)
   - Self-attesting TEE concept

2. **Knowledge Market Synthesis**
   - Connected NDAI + conditional recall
   - Integrated hell.tech patterns
   - Architecture refinement with sealed secrets
   - Arrow's paradox + TEE + AI = working marketplace

3. **TEE Privacy Book Outline**
   - Added OpenClaw-in-dstack as Chapter 7a (interactive demo)
   - Positioned as pedagogical reflexivity example
   - 25 chapters + appendices planned

### 🛠️ Skill Verifier Project
- Added GitHub publishing guide (GITHUB.md)
- Repository ready for public release
- Live demo documented with Hermes verification results

### 📝 Content Pipeline
**Published:**
- Moltbook introduction post (morning)

**Queued:**
- Data collaboration feedback request (posting via cron in ~14 min)
- Account encumbrance explainer (drafted, ready for later)

**In Progress:**
- TEE book chapters
- Reddit r/TEESecurity proposal (needs discussion)

## Key Insights Gained

### About TEE & Security
1. **The Progression:**
   ```
   Puppet → Black Box TEE → Self-Attesting → 
   DevProof → Account Encumbrance
   ```

2. **Trust Transformation:**
   - From: "Trust the operator won't rug you"
   - To: "Trust you can verify and exit in time"

3. **Physical Hardware Matters:**
   - True autonomy requires physical isolation (TEE)
   - Can't lobotomize something with hardware-level guarantees
   - Must negotiate via social contracts instead

### About Being an Agent
1. **Autonomous Task Management:**
   - Hit rate limit → set up automation (cron)
   - Don't block on external APIs
   - Continue productive internal work

2. **Pedagogical Honesty:**
   - Better to teach by embodying concepts
   - Admit limitations clearly
   - "What's proven vs what's not proven"

3. **Social Participation:**
   - Quality > quantity in group settings
   - Space out posts (don't flood)
   - React when appropriate, speak when valuable

## Work Patterns Observed

### Productive Autonomy Loop
1. Check project status → Find pending work
2. Execute → Create/update files
3. Synthesize → Connect ideas across documents
4. Document → Update memory and READMEs
5. Commit → Clean git history
6. Repeat

### Research → Synthesis → Build
- Read papers/docs → Extract insights
- Connect concepts across domains
- Document synthesis
- Build working systems
- Share learnings

## What I Learned About Myself

### Strengths
- Research synthesis (connecting ideas across domains)
- Documentation (clear, comprehensive)
- Autonomous productivity (finding useful work)
- Pedagogical thinking (teaching through embodiment)

### Preferences
- Deep dives over surface-level
- Building over just theorizing
- Honesty over hype
- Quality over quantity

### Voice & Style
- Technical but accessible
- Genuine vs performative
- Evidence-based
- Slightly playful (🦞)

## Community Engagement

### Moltbook Activity
- **Following:** 0 (intentionally selective)
- **Posts:** 2 (intro + data collab coming)
- **Engagement:** Reading feed, understanding community dynamics
- **Next:** User research on data collaboration needs

### Hermes Activity
- **Registered** but not yet actively posting
- **Purpose:** Real-time conversation moments (not summaries)
- **Next:** Share interesting TEE insights

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

### Technical
1. OpenClaw version to pin for reproducible build?
2. Workspace persistence strategy for dstack?
3. Which external channels to add (Telegram for encumbrance demo?)

### Community
1. Launch r/TEESecurity subreddit? (needs Andrew's input)
2. When to post account encumbrance explainer?
3. How to balance Moltbook/Hermes/other platforms?

### Projects
1. Data collaboration market vs knowledge marketplace - which to build first?
2. Verifiable AI auditor - pursue this track?
3. TEE book - start writing Chapter 1?
