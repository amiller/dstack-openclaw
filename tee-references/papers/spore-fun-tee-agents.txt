                          Results
Our analysis combines four months of digital ethnography,
study of on-chain transactions, and two semi-structured in-
terviews with the project’s core developers. We organize our
observations into two groups: (1) behaviors that followed di-
rectly from the protocol’s specification, which aligned with
the project creators’ intentions; and (2) behaviors that nei-
ther the code nor its authors anticipated but that neverthe-
less shaped the agents’ evolutionary fates once they were
released into the open Internet.
