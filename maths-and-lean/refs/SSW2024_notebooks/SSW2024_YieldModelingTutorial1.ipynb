To execute a code cell, click in the cell and then hit Shift+Enter. Alternatively, click within a cell and hit the Run button (play symbol). Depending on how you are running the notebook (via Google Colab or offline, and further depending on your installed version of Jupyter and/or Jupyter-lab), you may see slightly different options. The play symbol may appear in each cell, or above the cells in the toolbar.\n","\n","When a cell completes executing, a number will appear (or update) on the left-hand side of the cell. You can also execute some or all of the cells via options in the 'Runtime' menu, above.  Again, depending on how you are running this notebook you may have either a 'Run' or 'Runtime' menu, but both will have similar options for executing chunks of the code.\n","\n","**Important**: Note that some of the code blocks include exercises, with incomplete code, so you can't just run the whole notebook. You are strongly encouraged to go through the blocks one by one, in the order given.  Exercises do not need to be fully completed before proceeding to the next block.\n","\n","**Also Important**: Some of the exercises may be time-consuming. Reference solutions are provided for you for all of them in the `SSWYieldModelingTutorial.py` file provided in the same repository as this notebook.  You should feel free to skip some of the longer exercises and keep going."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"kOGZXwQ3bBt-","metadata":{"id":"kOGZXwQ3bBt-"},"source":["## &#128992; Setup Google Drive

Typically, we parametrize these observables as the projected separation between star and planet ($s$) and the difference in brightness between planet and star (their flux ratio on a logarithmic magnitude scale), which we call $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$.\n","\n","Both of these parameters are defined by treating the exoplanet and host star as a two-body system. A two-body (Keplerian) orbit is typically encoded via 6 variables. The first two of these are the semi-major axis ($a$) and eccentricity ($e$), which define the shape and size of the orbit. The semi-major axis sets the size of the orbit and the eccentricity (which can have a value between 0 and 1) measures the deviation of the orbit's shape from a circle.  All closed two-body orbits are ellipses with the star laying at one focus.  Circles are a special case of ellipses where $e = 0$.\n","\n","The next three parameters are angles that encode the orbit's orientation in 3-dimensions: the argument of periapsis ($\\omega$), the inclination ($I$), and the longitude of the ascending node ($\\Omega$). All five of these parameters are constant for a two-body orbit.  In order to locate where a planet is at a specific point in time, we need to introduce a sixth, time-varying parameter.  This can be any one of several angles (called anomalies), such as the true anomaly ($\\nu$), which measures the angle between the orbit's semi-major axis and the vector pointing from the star to the current position of the planet. All of these values are shown in the diagram, below:\n","\n","![exoplanet orbit diagram with annotations](https://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/ssw/hands-on/exoplanet_orbit_diagram_annotated.png)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4b2bd2bc-6549-40c8-9fd9-525402999f4d","metadata":{"id":"4b2bd2bc-6549-40c8-9fd9-525402999f4d"},"source":["The reference frame composed of the unit vectors $\\mathbf{\\hat{s}}_1, \\mathbf{\\hat{s}}_2, \\mathbf{\\hat{s}}_3$ is defined such that the observer (our telescope) is located along the $-\\mathbf{\\hat{s}}_3$ direction (so that when we point our telescope directly at the star, the vector from the observer to the star is in the positive $\\mathbf{\\hat{s}}_3$ direction.\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n","<b>Warning</b> An alternate convention exists for setting up this reference frame, with the observer placed on the positive $\\mathbf{\\hat{s}}_3$ direction, looking 'down' on the orbit.

Astropy units are incredibly helpful, as they automate unit conversions and remove a lot of the guesswork that often comes with dealing with inputs with some assumed units.  They also work (relatively) seamlessly with other common Python packages such as `numpy` (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/). Thus, executing `np.cos(np.pi*u.rad)` and `np.cos(180*u.deg)` will produce exactly the same value.  All that said, there are some potential pitfalls to operating on objects with units. For example, in the Lambert phase function define above, there is an implicit assumption that the $\\beta$ value is in radians (this assumption comes from the $\\pi - \\beta$) term.  Unfortunately, you cannot subtract a value with a unit from one without a unit, so you will need to strip the unit off of the $\\beta$ value before doing the subtraction. You can do this by using the object's `value` attribute.  For completeness sake, you should also ensure that the value is in radians before stripping the unit, so the full subtraction would look something like:\n","\n","`(np.pi -

values is to check whether or not a planet is visible at a given time.  The simplest way to do so is to define limits on observable projected separations and $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ values.  For projected separation, this actually maps quite well to how starlight-suppression systems work.  Essentially all such systems have an inner working angle (IWA) and outer working angle (OWA).  The inner and outer working angles represent the minimum and maximum angular separation between the host star and a detectable planets.  The reason for the existence of the inner working angle is two-fold.  At the most basic level, it is important to remember that real optical systems have finite angular resolutions.  That is, if we image a point source (a source of light with no spatial extent) by the time it is recorded on our detector, it will be spread out, taking up multiple pixels.  Therefore, there is a finite limit to how close two point sources can be in space before they become indistinguishable from one another when imaged by an optical system. On top of this, the devices we use to do high-contrast imaging are actually blocking out the star in order to image the planet, and (for lots of reasons) it is quite difficult to create regions of high contrast very close (in angular space) to the star, meaning that actual IWAs are many times larger than the angular resolution of the system.

As we continue to increase the luminosity, the habitable zone keeps moving outwards (which makes for easier IWA requirements) but the planets also get fainter (due to the reciprocal orbital radius magnitude term in the $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ equation), making instrumental limiting $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ requirements more challenging.

We can equivalently define the rates of photon arrival from each of these sources (which we'll represent with an overbar) such that our total measurement is:\n","$$z = \\bar{c}_pt_\\mathrm{int} +  \\bar{c}_bt_\\mathrm{int}$$\n","\n","We ultimately wish to make a statistical statement about what we thought we detected, which is typically encoded as a **signal to noise** (SNR) metric (or ratio).  SNR actually has *a lot* of formal definitions, which vary by field and application area, but the one most useful in our case is the ratio of the expectation value of the signal (the thing we wish to measure) to the standard deviation of the noise (everything else).  Photon arrival is a Poisson process&mdash;that is, the distribution of photons collected in a given span of time is governed by a Poisson distribution, which describes the probability of recording a certain number of events per unit time when the events have a constant rate of occurrence. One nice attribute of a Poisson distribution is that its standard deviation is equal to the square root of its mean value.\n","\n","So, under all these assumptions, our SNR metric is defined as:\n","$$\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{c}_pt_\\mathrm{int}}{\\sqrt{ \\bar{c}_pt_\\mathrm{int}  + \\bar{c}_bt_\\mathrm{int} }} = \\frac{\\bar{c}_p}{\\sqrt{ \\bar{c}_p  + \\bar{c}_b }} \\sqrt{t_\\mathrm{int}}$$\n","\n","Note that the denominator (the noise term) includes both the planet and background counts.  This is because Poisson noise (sometimes called **shot noise**) is generated by *all* incoming photons.  One immediate observation is that our SNR goes as the square root of integration time. So, if you want to double your SNR, you need to quadruple how long you collect photons for. The other thing to note is that this expression appears to predict that you can get to an arbitrarily high SNR if you are willing to integrate for an arbitrary long time.  This latter assertion is problematic because it is inherently non-physical for every optical system built to date.  In general, there will always be some **noise floor** (typically linked to the inherent stability of the optical system) that means that at a certain integration time, you stop gaining any SNR.

While our starlight suppression technologies are designed to remove light from the star, they cannot do so perfectly, and so there will always be some amount of starlight that makes it into our science images.  We characterize this quantity via our instrument's contrast ($C$): the ratio of off-axis flux (at the location where we're making our measurement) to the peak of the star's flux in a measurement taken *without* the starlight suppression system in place. This value essentially encodes how efficiently we are able to block starlight.  Note that while this value is similar to the $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$, it is inherently an instrumental property whereas $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ is an astrophysical one.  While many references may conflate the two, it is very important to understand the difference: $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ is what the universe gives you, while $C$ is what your instrument is designed to do.  Given the instrument's contrast, we can compute the count rate due to the star's residual (unblocked) light as:\n","$$\\bar{c}_{sr} =  C_\\mathrm{star} C A \\Delta\\lambda \\tau \\tau_\\mathrm{core} \\mathrm{QE} = C_\\mathrm{star} C\\eta \\tau_\\mathrm{core} $$\n","\n","Finally, we have background signal that is generated by the detector itself.  Modeling of detectors can get arbitrarily complicated, as there is a *lot* of very specific (and fascinating) physics in play here.  This is especially true when considering photon-counting detectors (literally devices that can, on average, track every individual photon intercepted).  Here, we will limit ourselves to two instrumental noise signals: dark current and read noise.\n","\n","Dark current is the signal generated by a detector even when it is not illuminated, while read noise consists of excess electrons that are generated by the process of reading out the detector (that is, literally collecting all of the light accumulated in the detector and converting it to a digital signal).  Both of these are (on average) per-pixel effects, and so we need to know the relevant number of pixels we should be computing these for.  This requires us to define the number of pixels covered by our photometric aperture:\n","$$N_\\mathrm{pix} = \\frac{\\Omega}{\\theta_\\mathrm{det}^2}$$\n","where $\\theta_\\mathrm{det}$ is the detector's pixel scale (the instantaneous field of view of each detector pixel).\n","The dark current count rate is then:\n","$$\\bar{c}_\\mathrm{dark} = N_\\mathrm{pix} i_\\mathrm{dark}$$\n","where $i_\\mathrm{dark}$ is the dark current rate, measured in counts/second/pixel.\n","\n","All of the preceding count rates have come from processes that are (or can be safely modeled as) continuous.  That is, for our astrophysical sources and starlight residual and dark current, we are accumulating photons (counts or digital numbers) throughout the length of an observation that have some average arrival rate, such that we can multiply these rates by the total integration time to get the expectation value for our recorded signal.  Read noise, however, is different as it represents a *discrete* process.  Counts due to read noise are only generated when we read out our detector.  We could do this once per observation, but that tends to be a bad idea because of the accumulation of cosmic rays, which tend to saturate our detector, as well as some other more finicky effects. So, in typical usage, we will read out our detector multiple times within the span of a single observation, and then sum the results.  To model this, we introduce the exposure time ($t_\\mathrm{exp}$) parameter, which encodes the duration of each readout exposure.  The number of readouts is therefore given by $t_\\mathrm{int}/t_\\mathrm{exp}$. Because we have the integration time in the numerator, we can still compute a 'rate' for the contribution of the read noise, which will have the form:\n","$$\\bar{c}_\\mathrm{read} = N_\\mathrm{pix} \\frac{i_\\mathrm{read}}{t_\\mathrm{exp}}$$\n","where $i_\\mathrm{read}$ is the read noise in units of electrons/pixel/readout."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"95f1f1a1-1d05-4813-b390-e3464e085d4b","metadata":{"id":"95f1f1a1-1d05-4813-b390-e3464e085d4b"},"source":["## Modeling the Noise Floor\n","\n","Perhaps the most difficult aspect of all of this to model is the noise floor ($M$). Conceptually, this term represents the part of the background signal that cannot be subtracted or otherwise removed from our measurements.  This implies that this term has to do with a variability in our optical system that we cannot model.  Formally, we can describe this as a variability in our instrument's **point spread function** (or impulse response).  The actual part of the background signal that will be most affected by such variability is the residual starlight that cannot be fully suppressed.  We know, thanks to experience with high-performance, ground-based coronagraphs as well as space-based instrument on the Hubble and other observatories that we are able to subtract the contributions of some, but not all of this term, so we define a new variable, called the post-processing factor ($f_p$) such that:\n","$$M = \\bar{c}_{sr} f_p \\,.$$\n","The post-processing factor should be interpreted as the reciprocal of our expected ability to suppress residual starlight, such that $f_p = 0.1$ represents the assumption that our intrinsic noise floor lies at a factor of 10 below the residual starlight."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"44a81625-3185-40be-b3a7-be2f3b1dcc1b","metadata":{"id":"44a81625-3185-40be-b3a7-be2f3b1dcc1b"},"source":["## Exercise 7\n","\n","We now have all of the equations we need in order to implement a calculation of the planet, background, and noise floor count rates (the inputs to our previously written integration time calculation), so let's do just that.  \n","\n","First, a few implementation notes.  As you can see, there are a *lot* of inputs.  To make our lives a little easier, we will package these into three dictionaries: `static_params` (the values we expect to be more or less constant between different observations), `coronagraph` (values encoding the performance of the starlight suppression system) and `target` (values encoding the particulars of a given observation). Defining these dictionaries serves to prevent errors due to keeping track of the position of a lot of required inputs.\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n","<b>Warning</b> A key thing to keep in mind is that much of the modeling described in the previous section is greatly simplified, and omits a lot of finicky details that become important as you try to compute realistic integration times and count rates. Furthermore, many of the values (such as all of the coronagraph parameters and some of the detector parametrs) are not actually constants, but depend on other parameters such as wavelength, and the separation angles between the star and the planet. Our various simplifications are fine in the context of this tutorial, but be careful in trying to apply any of this in the real world.\n","</div>\n","\n","You'll also note that there are a lot of units floating around these calculations.  We will again make use of `astropy`'s `Unit` class (https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/) to help us, but these still have some limitations.  Most importantly, you cannot use an `astropy` `Quantity` object in an exponent, so we will omit the units on the zodi and exozodi brightness inputs.  Similarly, mathematical operations on quantities with units will work as expected, but may produce results with mixed units (for example nanometers divided by meters).  Every `Quantity` object has a useful built-in method called `decompose()` which will automatically resolve such mixtures to a single base unit.  Similarly, if you ever wish to extract the unit or value of a given quantity object `q`, you can call `q.unit` and `q.value`, respectively.\n","\n","One more important note on units: there are cases where you divide two length units and expect the result to be an angle quantity (for example $\\lambda/D$ is an angle such that if both inputs have the same length unit, the output is in radians).  The `Quantity` objects aren't quite smart enough to figure this out on their own, but allow you to specify those cases where dimensionless quantities should be interpreted as angles, via the `equivalencies` keyword input to the `to` conversion method.

There are basically two options (with many possible minor variations):\n","\n","1. Integrate on every target star to the same $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ - that is, compute the integration time for each target using the same input $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ value to the integration time equation.\n","2. Select integration times on every star to achieve different maximum $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ and optimize the overall observing program to maximize the total accumulated completeness.\n","\n","The two approaches lead to different observing schedules and (likely) different mission outcomes.  While it may initially appear that the latter (optimization) approach is clearly superior, it is important to understand that both methodologies have pros and cons.  The first approach produces a uniform survey and ensures that we can set a uniform bound on the existence of planets for all of the stars we observe. This makes it simpler to make statements about the actual population of planets that are out there once the survey is completed.  Such statements are also possible with the optimization approach, but require a lot more detailed modeling and careful treatment of the survey model that is used for population inference.\n","\n","On the other hand, integrating to a high $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ value on a dim star is wasteful, and that time is likely better spent observing multiple brighter stars, or doing repeated observations on a previously discovered planet.  The completeness maximization approach makes such decisions automated and guarantees a maximized survey completeness (at least on paper).  However, you should never forget that all of the statements being made here are *statistical* in nature.  The maximum summed completeness produced by the numerical optimization represents an expectation value - it is the completeness we would achieve, on average, if we were able to run our experiment (the survey) many times over.  In reality, however, we only get to do the survey once, and it is impossible to detect fractional planets.  It would be a major bummer if we failed to discover a planet because our numerical optimization told us to integrate for a bit shorter on a given star, and the planet was just a bit dimmer than what our resulting observation could detect.  Conversely, the time we save on that integration could allow us to add another target to our list and therefore improve our odds of finding a planet elsewhere.  In short: this is very much an active area of research, and more remains to be said here.\n","\n","For now, let's focus on how we would implement the two approaches.  Remember that we have set up our machinery to compute completeness as a function of limiting $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$. That means that if we are taking approach 1, we can just select our target $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ for the survey, and directly compute the completeness values and integration times associated with this $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ value for all of our targets.\n","\n","On the other hand, if we are taking approach 2, then we must be able to compute achieved completeness as a function of integration time.  This means that we must also be able to compute the maximum achievable $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ for a given integration time. We do so by inverting our integration time calculation. Luckily for us, our expression from above is analytically invertible (which is not necessarily the case for all integration time models).  First, we invert the integration time expression via the quadratic equation:\n","$$t_\\mathrm{int} = \\frac{ \\bar{c}_p + \\bar{c}_b }{\\left(\\dfrac{\\bar{c}_p}{\\mathrm{SNR}}\\right)^2 - M^2} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\bar{c}_p = \\frac{\\mathrm{SNR} \\left(\\mathrm{SNR} + \\sqrt{4 M^{2} t_\\mathrm{int}^{2} + 4 \\bar{c}_b t_\\mathrm{int} + \\mathrm{SNR}^{2}}\\right)}{2 t_\\mathrm{int}} \\,.$$\n","Note that we use only the solution that yields a positive value (as negative count rates are non-physical).  We next solve our $\\bar{c}_p$ model for $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$:\n","$$\\bar{c}_p = \\mathcal{F}_0 10^{-0.4(\\mathrm{mag}_\\mathrm{star}+ \\Delta\\mathrm{mag})}\\eta\\tau_\\mathrm{core} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad   \\Delta\\mathrm{mag} = -\\mathrm{mag}_\\mathrm{star} -2.5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\bar{c}_p}{\\mathcal{F}_0\\eta\\tau_\\mathrm{core}}  \\right) \\,.$$\n","\n","Substituting the former expression into the latter gives us a way of computing $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ given an integration time (and therefore the completeness generated by a given integration time).

Missions are finite, especially those that make use of consumables such as fuel, or cryogens, or anything else that will eventually run out.  Worse yet, integration time for exoplanet observations is only a fraction of the overall mission time.  For each target, there will be some time needed to set up the observation (point at the target, wait for the observatory to equilibrate, dig a dark hole if using a coronagraph, etc.).  There will also be overhead time on each target (time needed to maintain the dark hole or observatory pointing, or to control a starshade, if using one).  All of this adds up quite rapidly.  Worse still: there will be silly people out there who want to use your observatory for science other than exoplanet imaging, and, of course, we have to share.

The whole point of exoplanet imaging is that we are creating an incredibly dark region in our focal plane in which we can try to collect the scant few photons exoplanets provide us.  If our observatory happens to be pointing in the vicinity of something bright (such as the Sun, or Earth, or even the moon), then that rather defeats the point.  Because of this, there will be so-called **keepout** regions - pointing geometries that are disallowed because they stray too near a bright foreground source. At the same time, depending on how the solar panels are mounted on our observatory, we may have disallowed pointing geometries because they would leave our solar panels unilluminated, meaning that there would not be enough power to run the observatory. Here is a schematic representation of the keepout regions for the sun, for an observatory placed on a Sun-Earth $L_2$ halo orbit (this is a large, periodic (in the rotating or synodic frame) orbit about the Sun-Earth 2nd Lagrange point, such that the sun, Earth, and moon, are always in the same general direction with respect to the observatory):\n","\n","![keepout schematic](https://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/ssw/hands-on/keepout_diagram.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0c67796d-d5be-42d3-920d-561267689f91","metadata":{"id":"0c67796d-d5be-42d3-920d-561267689f91"},"source":["In the diagram, created by Gabriel Soto and published in Soto et al. 2019 (https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.G003747), $\\mathcal R$ represents the rotating frame, with $\\mathbf{x}$ always pointing from the sun to the Earth (and to the second Lagrange point). The target star cannot lie anywhere within the shaded region to the left of $L_2$ because the sun would shine light into the telescope.  At the same time, a target star cannot lie anywhere within the shaded region to the right of $L_2$ because sunlight would reflect off of the starshade (if using one) and back into the telescope.

Here, we will briefly discuss how these blocks are put together.  We start with a description of our mission, including an instrument and observatory design, an input target list, and a statement of mission constraints (nominally the total mission time, the fraction of that time available for exoplanet science, and the parameters that allow us to evaluate a keepout map for our target list). We must then generate a mission schedule, consisting of a list of observing times and durations (that is, when we wish to integrate on a given target, and for how long). This schedule must fully conform to our mission constraints (e.g. no looking at stars when they're in keepout, and no exceeding your time allocation).\n","\n","For each observation, we can then compute the maximum achievable planet $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ and from this, the completeness of the observation for a planet population of interest. We sum all of these completeness values together to get the total mission completeness.  This value, in turn, is multiplied by the assumed occurrence rate of planets (frequently called $\\eta$, or $\\eta_\\oplus$ for Earth-like planets specifically). This value:\n","$$\\eta \\sum_i c_i $$\n","where $c_i$ are the completeness values of each observation in our mission schedule, is the expected detection yield of our
