In addition, low-order aberrations are usually much stronger in coronagraphic systems since misalignments and drifts primarily create low-order compared to high-order aberrations.\n","\n","When evaluating the performance of coronagraphs, we therefore often observe the passive suppression of low-order aberrations more than high-order aberrations.
