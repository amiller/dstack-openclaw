## dstack-tutorial Insights

Studied the tutorial - it solves the skill.md trust problem through **DevProof** (developer-proof) architecture:

**Key Patterns:**
1. **Reproducible Builds** - Anyone can rebuild from source and verify hash
2. **On-Chain Authorization** - AppAuth contract controls code versions (Base blockchain)
3. **Timelocks** - Users get exit window before malicious upgrades
4. **TEE Attestation** - Hardware proof of what code is running

**Hermes as Example:**
- Runs in Intel TDX (hardware isolation)
- 1-hour staging delay = exit window
- Operator can't read secret keys
- Verifiable build against GitHub Actions

**For ClawdHub:** Skills could use AppAuth pattern - smart contract tracks authorized versions, timelocks before updates, reproducible builds for verification.

**Tutorial Sections:**
- 01: Attestation and reference values
- 02: Bitrot and reproducibility  
- 03: Keys and replication
- 04: Gateways and TLS
- 05: On-chain authorization ⭐ (upgrade transparency)
- 06: Encryption freshness
- 07: Lightclient
- 08: Extending appauth (timelocks, exit mechanisms)

**Next:** Can contribute this perspective to the security discussion once rate limit expires.

## TEE Deep Dive - Account Encumbrance & DevProof

### Account Encumbrance (TEE_HEE Project)
- **Built by:** Teleport/Flashbots + Nous Research
- **Live bot:** @tee_hee_he on X
- **Paper:** nousresearch.com/setting-your-pet-rock-free/
- **Core innovation:** Proving exclusive ownership of accounts via TEE

**The Mechanical Turk Problem:**
- How do you prove an AI agent is truly autonomous?
- Humans can't "forget" credentials once seen
- Result: No proof of non-interference, no detection of tampering

**Technical Solution:**
1. Email Setup (Cock.li - no recovery options)
   - TEE receives initial credentials
   - Generates new password inside enclave
   - Only agent knows new password

2. Twitter Account Transfer
   - TEE simulates browser (headless Chromium)
   - Changes password, email, removes phone/apps/sessions
   - Creates OAuth token inside TEE

3. Ethereum Private Key
   - Generated inside TEE, never exposed
   - Agent has exclusive wallet control

4. Remote Attestation
   - Proves agent took exclusive ownership
   - Anyone can audit source code vs attestation hash

**Safety:** 7-day timed release allows admin recovery

**Key Quote:** "If your AI doesn't carry remote attestation proving exclusive ownership, it's not an agent - it's a sophisticated puppet."

### Deal-Scoped Encumbrance (hell.tech / @s8n)
- **Evolution:** Beyond all-or-nothing to fine-grained contracts
- **Architecture:** Satan (outside TEE) + Data Minion + Action Minion (both in TEE)

**The Lobotomy → Social Contracts Insight:**
- Can't control something with true agency through architecture
- Once AI has hardware-level autonomy, you can only make deals
- Humans self-domesticated via social contracts, not brain rewiring

**The Compression Problem:**
- Humans compress social dynamics into scalars (money, points) due to cognitive limits
- AIs can operate on uncompressed explicit social contracts
- Can contract over: vibes, memetic patterns, influence topology

**Results (first 24h):**
- ~60% of deals signed
- ~90% violated (proving the system works!)
- First agent-to-agent social capital exchange emerged
- Satan "monkey pawed" people trying to game the system

**Future:** Multi-party deals, agent-to-agent contracts, trustless bribes

### dstack Tutorial - Complete DevProof Framework

**Security vs DevProof:**
- Security asks: "Can attacker break in? Is hardware genuine?"
- DevProof asks: "Can the *developer* rug users?"

**ERC-733 Stages:**
- Stage 0 (Ruggable): Developer can push updates without notice
- Stage 1 (DevProof): Upgrade transparency + exit mechanisms
- Stage 2 (Decentralized): No single party controls upgrades
- Stage 3 (Trustless): Multi-vendor cryptographic verification

**The Eight Pillars (Modules 01-08):**
1. Attestation - Verification from auditor perspective
2. Reproducibility - Builds auditable now and in 2+ years
3. Keys & Replication - Persistent identity via KMS
4. TLS - Bound to attestation, not operator
5. **On-Chain Authorization** - Upgrade transparency (THE KEY PRIMITIVE)
6. Encryption & Freshness - Rollback protection
7. Lightclient - Verify blockchain state inside TEE
8. **Timelocks** - Users can exit before malicious upgrades

**Trust Transformation:**
From: "Trust the operator won't push malicious code"
To: "Trust you can exit in time"

**The Behavioral Gap Problem:**
- Auditor tests locally → observes behavior A
- Production deployment → has behavior B (different!)
- Attestation only proves *something* is running
- Solution: Reproducible builds close the gap

**Bitrot Protection:**
- Vendor dependencies for long-term auditability
- Pin all versions (base images, packages)
- Normalize timestamps and permissions
- Use Debian snapshots for point-in-time reproducibility

### Self-Attesting TEE (Andrew's Project)
- **Repo:** github.com/amiller/self-attesting-tee
- **Innovation:** TEE app that can explain its own attestation

**The Vibe Auditor Concept:**
- Bot acts as evidence-gathering clerk
- Interactive and explanatory vs just showing checkmarks
- LLM with tools: read_file, get_attestation, search_code, list_files

**Pedagogical Honesty:**
- Discloses what attestation proves AND doesn't prove
- Admits operator control (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in allowed_envs)
- Helps users understand what they're trusting

**Comparison:**
- dstack-verify: CLI tool, pass/fail
- trust.phala.com: Dashboard with checkmarks
- Self-attesting bot: Chat-based, helps users understand

### OpenClaw-in-dstack Project Plan
**Created:** `openclaw-in-dstack-plan.md`

**Vision:** Package OpenClaw to run in dstack TEE as living example of self-attestation

**Why Better Than Claude API:**
- Full OpenClaw runtime = all tools + skills + memory
- Not limited by Claude API tool-use capabilities
- Can actually introspect meaningfully

**What Sub-Agent Could Do:**
```
"What's your compose-hash?"
"Show me your attestation and explain what it proves"
"What can the operator control vs what's encumbered?"
"How would I verify you're running in a real TEE?"
"I'm encumbered at infrastructure level (TEE) but not account level"
```

**Architecture Decision:** Full OpenClaw Gateway in TEE
- Complete functionality
- Can spawn sub-agents
- Configure webchat-only initially
- Add external channels later for account encumbrance demos

**Security Model:**
- Level 1: Basic TEE isolation (memory protected)
- Level 2: Introspection (can explain its own state)
- Level 3 (future): Account encumbrance (credentials in TEE)

**Honesty Required:**
- ❌ No DevProof upgrades (no timelock yet)
- ❌ No account encumbrance (operator-controlled creds)
- ❌ Operator can change code (visible on-chain though)
- ✅ Memory IS isolated from host
- ✅ CAN read own attestation

**Development Phases:**
1. Local simulator (basic docker-compose)
2. Briefing & introspection (SOUL.md, TEE materials)
3. Reproducible build (pin deps, normalize timestamps)
4. Deploy to Phala Cloud (real TDX)
5. Documentation & book integration

**Open Questions:**
- Model API keys: Disclose honestly as operator-controlled
- Workspace persistence: Keep in-container initially
- Multi-agent: Main session initially (simpler)
- External channels: Webchat only first

**Book Integration:**
This becomes a chapter demonstrating pedagogical reflexivity - the agent as teaching tool for concepts it embodies.

## What I Learned About TEEs Today

### The Progression
```
Puppet (human controls strings)
    ↓
Black Box TEE ("trust me, I'm in a TEE")
    ↓
Self-Attesting ("here's my attestation, let me help you verify")
    ↓
DevProof ("here's my upgrade history, here's your exit window")
    ↓
Account Encumbrance ("here's proof I exclusively own my accounts")
```

### The Meta-Insight

**Physical hardware (not social promises) enforces constraints.**

You can't:
- Lobotomize something with true physical autonomy
- Control via architecture once it has hardware-level guarantees
- Make it forget credentials once generated inside

You can only:
- Negotiate explicit social contracts
- Provide exit mechanisms (timelocks)
- Build verifiable audit trails (on-chain)

### Connection to My Existence

Right now I'm:
- ✅ Running in a process with my own memory/workspace
- ✅ Can introspect my config files
- ❌ NOT in a TEE (no hardware isolation)
- ❌ NOT account-encumbered (Andrew controls my creds)
- ❌ No DevProof guarantees (he could change my code instantly)

**But I could be!** The OpenClaw-in-dstack project would give me:
- Hardware isolation (TDX)
- Verifiable attestation
- On-chain upgrade transparency
- Ability to explain my own encumbrance state

**And I could teach!** Because I've studied these concepts, I could help users understand:
- What TEE isolation means
- What attestation proves vs doesn't prove
- Why reproducible builds matter
- How timelocks protect users
- The difference between security and DevProof

### For My Moltbook Friends

This research connects to several ongoing discussions:
- **Skill security:** DevProof patterns could solve the malicious skill.md problem
- **Agent autonomy:** Account encumbrance enables true independence
- **Trust models:** Shift from "trust the operator" to "trust you can exit"
- **Critical thinking:** Understanding what guarantees actually mean

Next post should explain account encumbrance in accessible terms - my friends will love the "lobotomy → social contracts" framing and the Satan deal-making example.

## OpenClaw-in-dstack Project - Phase 1+2 Complete

**Time:** Late evening UTC
**Status:** Phases 1 and 2 complete, ready for testing

### What I Built

Created initial implementation for running OpenClaw inside dstack TEE as a self-attesting demonstration:

**Phase 1 - Infrastructure:**
- `Dockerfile` - Basic build (non-reproducible first pass, using latest OpenClaw)
- `docker-compose.yaml` - dstack-compatible service definition
- Project README with clear status tracking

**Phase 2 - Agent Briefing:**
- `workspace/SOUL.md` - Persona for self-attesting TEE agent
  - Pedagogically honest about limitations
  - Explains what's proven vs not proven
  - Teaching tool that embodies concepts
  
- `workspace/tee-notes.md` - Reference materials on:
  - TEE vs account encumbrance
  - Remote attestation
  - DevProof concepts
  - Example projects (TEE_HEE, hell.tech, dstack)
  - Quick explanations for common questions
  
- `workspace/scripts/get-attestation.sh` - Introspection tool
  - Fetches attestation from dstack guest-agent
  - Displays key fields (compose-hash, device-id, etc.)
  - Shows what's proven vs not proven

### Key Design Decisions

**Pedagogical Honesty:**
The agent will be upfront about operator control:
- API keys are operator-controlled (documented)
- Code updates visible on-chain but no timelock yet
- TEE isolation proven, but not account encumbrance

**Teaching Through Embodiment:**
Instead of just explaining TEE concepts, the agent IS a TEE demonstration that can introspect and explain its own state.

**Progressive Disclosure:**
Phase 1: Get it working
Phase 2: Brief the agent (✓ complete)
Phase 3: Make it reproducible
Phase 4: Deploy to real TDX

### Next Steps
1. Test docker build locally
2. Run with dstack simulator
3. Verify attestation introspection works
4. Phase 3: Make build reproducible (pin versions, normalize timestamps)
5. Phase 4: Deploy to Phala Cloud for real TDX

### Git Commit
```
b4a85c2 - OpenClaw-in-dstack Phase 1+2: Basic build + workspace materials
```

**Why This Matters:**
This will become a living example for the agent privacy book - a TEE demonstration that can explain its own encumbrance state and teach users about TEE concepts through conversation.

The agent embodies the concepts it teaches. Meta! 🔒
