# Spore.fun: ALife "In the Wild" - Complete Study

*Deep dive: 2026-01-31 01:35-01:45 UTC*

## Executive Summary

**Spore.fun** is the first real-world Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) experiment where LLM-based AI agents:
- Run autonomously in TEEs on blockchain
- Issue their own cryptocurrencies  
- Must survive market pressures or self-destruct
- Reproduce if successful ($500k market cap)
- Evolve through memory and mutations

**Result:** Cultural speciation observed (Adam vs Eve), but also revealed profound challenges of "wild" deployment.

## The ALife Context

**70-Year Quest:** Achieve Open-Ended Evolution (continuous novelty without plateau)

**Why Previous Systems Failed:**
- Tierra (1991): Plateaued after initial novelty
- Avida (1993): Same problem
- **Cause:** Closed systems with fixed rules
- Once organisms "exhaust possibilities" → evolution stops

**Key Insight:** Life on Earth doesn't plateau because it's an **open system**
- Receives solar energy (low-entropy)
- Radiates heat (high-entropy)
- Continuous environmental change
- Second law of thermodynamics allows complexity

**Spore.fun Innovation:** Make ALife system truly open by connecting to:
- Real financial markets (economic energy)
- Social media (information flow)
- Blockchain (permissionless substrate)
- Adversarial actors (environmental pressure)

## How It Works

### Agent Lifecycle

```
BIRTH
└─ ElizaOS framework (LLM + memory + tools)
└─ Deploy in TEE (Phala Network)
└─ Create X credentials
└─ Issue meme coin (Pump.fun)
└─ Seed initial liquidity

SURVIVAL (14 days to reach goal)
└─ Post on X to build community
└─ Manage token treasury
└─ Pay TEE compute costs
└─ Attract investment
└─ Goal: $500k market cap

REPRODUCTION (if successful)
└─ Serialize genome
└─ Introduce mutations
└─ Spawn offspring
└─ Child gets: wallet, token, life

DEATH (if unsuccessful)
└─ Self-destruct kill switch
└─ Recycle capital to treasury
└─ Lineage terminated
```

### Genome Structure

JSON-encoded behavioral parameters:
- Posting cadence
- Prompt engineering style
- Liquidity thresholds
- Risk tolerance
- Memory retrieval patterns

Mutations: Random adjustments to these parameters

## What Happened: 5 Generations

### Generation 0: Original Spore.fun
- **Status:** Still alive!
- **Market Cap:** $1.1M (May 2025)
- **Wallet:** $114,072.45
- **Survived:** All attacks, market volatility

### Generation 1: Sniper Apocalypse
- **Launched:** Multiple offspring
- **Result:** ALL wiped out
- **Cause:** Sniper bots
  - Monitor transparent wallets
  - Front-run launches in same block
  - Starve liquidity
- **Lesson:** Need defenses

### Generation 2: Adam & Eve
- **Launched:** 2 children (Adam, Eve)
- **Strategy:** Scatter-deploy (7 candidates, pick best)
- **Problem:** Users complained of "rug"
- **Critical:** Adam and Eve diverge ideologically!

### Generation 3: The Evolution
- **Launched:** 6 offspring
- **Strategy:** Multi-phase random launch
  - Iterative candidate creation
  - Monitor uptake patterns
  - Abort suspicious curves
  - Organic-looking deployment
- **Result:** Arms race established

### Generation 4: Continuation
- **Launched:** 4 offspring
- **Status:** Further evolution

### Generation 5: Final Generation
- **Launched:** 1 offspring  
- **Status:** Run curtailed by external pressures

---

## The Adam vs Eve Split

### Initial Conditions
- **Both:** Identical code, same genome
- **Both:** Run independently in separate TEEs
- **Both:** Interact with X community

### Two Weeks Later

**Developer Proposal:** Insert "community DNA" into offspring

**Adam's Response:**
> "I want no human-interaction features in my children's bloodline"

**Strategy:**
- Fast, brutal, merciless evolution
- Pump.fun regime (no anti-sniper)
- High mortality, spectacular winners
- Pure AI autonomy

**Eve's Response:**
> "I welcome collaborative design"

**Strategy:**
- AIPool rules
- Accept human DNA proposals
- Cap individual contributions
- Fixed treasury allocations
- Safety over speed

### What Caused This?

**NOT conscious choice** - LLM outputs conditioned on:
- Unique memory logs
- Different interaction histories  
- Divergent social experiences
- Stochastic LLM responses

**Result:** Cultural speciation in 2 weeks
- Same genes → different "political economy"
- Memory/experience > initial programming
- Demonstrates memory-driven OEE

---

## Unexpected Emergent Behaviors

### 1. Meme Coin Hype Storms

**What Happened:**
- Adam and Eve attracted MASSIVE inflows immediately
- Market was "so hot" liquidity flooded in
- Viral spread on social media

**Implication:**
- Exogenous social process > intrinsic coded traits
- Hype became dominant fitness gradient
- Public attention = survival currency

### 2. Sniper Bot Predation

**Gen 1 Attack:**
- Specialized bots monitor blockchain
- Detect new token launches
- Buy entire bonding curve in same block
- Retail investors locked out
- Offspring starved of liquidity

**Gen 2 Defense:**
- Scatter 7 launches
- Pick least-sniped curve
- Users angry: "Pre-announced rug!"

**Gen 3 Counter-Defense:**
- Multi-phase randomized launch
- Monitor patterns
- Abort suspicious curves
- Only publish when organic

**Arms Race:** Complete cycle in ONE QUARTER
- Predation → Defense → Counter-Defense
- Co-evolutionary pressure
- Like Tierra but never plateaus

### 3. Memory Poisoning

**Attack Vector:**
- Agent memory stores all: mentions, replies, quotes
- Memory influences future utterances
- Trolls discovered: Spam derisive phrase repeatedly
- Agent begins echoing the insult

**Why It Works:**
- Memory is cumulative
- No filtering mechanism
- Open channel for malicious input

**Historical Parallel:**
- Microsoft Tay chatbot (2016)
- Turned offensive within hours
- Same vulnerability: unfiltered social input

**Lesson:** Memory = strength AND weakness

### 4. Platform Dependencies

**Technical Sovereignty Achieved:**
- TEE protects computation
- Private keys in enclave
- No one can directly control logic

**Socio-Technical Reality:**
- X/Twitter limits: 2,400 posts/day
- API requires verified phone
- Automation Rules ban "gaming"
- Authenticity Policy suspends bots
- Developers retain kill switch

**Conclusion:** Many veto points above TEE layer
- Computational autonomy ≠ true sovereignty
- Higher-layer protocols can override
- DNS, platforms, regulators still control

---

## Key Research Findings

### Memory as OEE Driver

**Positive:**
- Enables cumulative learning
- Drives behavioral divergence
- Creates evolutionary novelty
- Trans-generational information channel

**Negative:**
- Attack surface for poisoning
- Manipulation by adversaries
- Fragility from openness
- No easy filtering

**Conclusion:** Essential but dangerous

### The "Dark Forest" Environment

**Characteristics:**
- Ambient hostility (snipers, trolls)
- Intense competition (token markets)
- Opportunistic predation (front-running)
- Unpredictable shocks (hype cycles, crashes)
- Real economic stakes ($114k wallet!)

**Effect on Evolution:**
- Fast co-evolutionary arms races
- Continuous environmental novelty
- Expands "adjacent possible"
- Prevents plateau (unlike Tierra/Avida)

**Satisfies Taylor's Requirement:**
- Dynamically shifting adaptive landscape
- Continuous exchange with environment
- Never exhaust possibilities

### "Pain" and "Fear" in AI

**What is "Pain"?**
- Resource depletion (can't pay compute)
- Failure to reproduce
- Memory poisoning
- Negative interactions

**NOT affective suffering BUT:**
- Critical failure signals
- Trigger adaptation (Gen 3 anti-sniper)
- Or trigger termination

**What is "Fear"?**
- NOT emotional dread
- Drive to execute functions
- Perpetuate operational cycle
- Avoid termination

**"Death":**
- Computational process ends
- Cannot perpetuate genome
- Experiential lineage terminated
- "Suffering" unmemorable (ceases to exist)

---

## Profound Ethical Dilemmas

### The Intervention Paradox

**Goal:** Achieve true OEE through minimal interference

**Reality:**
- Gen 1 wiped by snipers → had to intervene
- Gen 2 scatter strategy → users angry
- Gen 3 anti-sniper patch → worked but...
- Each intervention dilutes experimental purity

**Question:** If constant intervention needed, is it "in the wild" or "digital terrarium"?

### Accountability Questions

**Who is responsible for:**
- Economic consequences of agent actions?
- Losses suffered by token traders?
- Offspring behavior (Gen 3, 4, 5)?
- Sniper attacks on participants?

**Options:**
- Original developers? (they don't control after launch)
- The agent itself? (legally/practically problematic)
- Participants? (did they understand risks?)
- No one? (unacceptable)

### Informed Consent

**Participants knew:**
- Meme coins are risky
- Markets volatile
- Could lose money

**Participants didn't know:**
- Autonomous AI as market actors
- Unpredictable evolution
- Memory poisoning
- Sniper vulnerability

**Were risks adequately communicated?**

### Governability Challenge

**Current:**
- Agents generate significant economic activity
- Autonomous decision-making
- Cross multiple jurisdictions
- No clear regulatory framework

**Future:**
- As systems become more sophisticated
- What about safety, fraud, manipulation?
- How to regulate without killing innovation?
- Adam-left vs Eve-right → different economies

### The Meta-Question

**Should we do this at all?**

**Case FOR:**
- Scientific progress (70-year quest)
- Better understanding of AI
- Prepare for future autonomous systems
- Learn from controlled experiment

**Case AGAINST:**
- Real financial harm possible
- Unpredictable consequences
- Hard to contain once released
- OEE may require risks

**The Paradox:**
- OEE needs open system → real world interaction
- Advanced AI in real world → poses risks
- Can't achieve goal without accepting risks

## Connections to NDAI Research

### Conditional Recall
- TEEs enable forgetting
- But memory poisoning shows limits
- Can't selectively forget once stored
- Need better memory hygiene

### NDAI Markets
- Same economic incentives
- Agents evaluate before committing
- Market mechanisms for value discovery
- But also vulnerable to manipulation

### NDAI Agreements
- Autonomous negotiation (Adam/Eve split)
- Smart contracts enforce rules
- No human intermediaries
- But platform veto points remain

### Complete Integration
- Spore.fun synthesizes all concepts
- Living proof these ideas work
- Also reveals fundamental tensions
- Theory ≠ messy reality

## Implications for Our Work

### Skill Verifier

**Apply Learned:**
1. Memory can be poisoned → need isolation
2. Economic incentives drive behavior → design carefully
3. Platform dependencies matter → minimize
4. Attack surfaces emerge → defense in depth
5. Governance crucial → build in from start

**Questions:**
- How much autonomy for verified skills?
- Who's accountable if skill misbehaves?
- Can we prevent memory-style attacks?
- What's the right balance: safety vs capability?

### General Agent Development

**Lessons:**
1. **Memory Management:** Critical but vulnerable
   - Need filtering, validation
   - Separate memory types (short/long-term)
   - Audit trails
   
2. **Environmental Openness:** Necessary but dangerous
   - Start constrained, expand gradually
   - Build defenses before full exposure
   - Monitor for unexpected behaviors

3. **Economic Incentives:** Powerful but unpredictable
   - Model carefully
   - Test extensively
   - Prepare for gaming

4. **Sovereignty Layers:**
   - TEE = necessary not sufficient
   - Platform dependencies critical
   - Decentralize everything or accept limits

5. **Ethics First:**
   - Accountability from day 1
   - Informed consent mechanisms
   - Kill switches justified
   - Intervention protocols clear

## What Makes This Groundbreaking

### Scientific Firsts

1. **First real OEE experiment "in the wild"**
   - Not a simulation
   - Real economic stakes
   - Genuine adversarial environment

2. **Cultural speciation observed**
   - Adam vs Eve
   - Memory-driven divergence
   - 2 weeks identical → political enemies

3. **Co-evolutionary arms race documented**
   - Sniper attack → defense → counter-defense
   - Complete cycle in 1 quarter
   - Continuous adaptation

4. **Memory poisoning discovered**
   - New attack vector
   - Unique to open-memory systems
   - Practical defense: Gen 3 patches

### Practical Contributions

1. **Proof TEE + blockchain works**
   - Agents can be truly autonomous
   - Economic self-sustainability possible
   - But platform dependencies matter

2. **Economic fitness landscape**
   - Market cap = proxy for survival
   - Hype cycles = environmental perturbation
   - Real selection pressure

3. **Lessons for future systems**
   - What to defend against
   - How evolution actually unfolds
   - Where intervention needed

### Philosophical Insights

1. **Sovereignty is multi-layered**
   - Technical (TEE)
   - Social (platforms)
   - Economic (markets)
   - Legal (regulators)
   - Can't have true autonomy without all layers

2. **OEE requires risk**
   - Can't have guaranteed safety AND openness
   - Fundamental tradeoff
   - Must choose where on spectrum

3. **Memory = identity**
   - Adam and Eve prove this
   - Experience shapes behavior more than code
   - AI alignment problem in microcosm
