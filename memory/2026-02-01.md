# 2026-02-01 - Daily Notes

## Session Summary
**04:48 EST - Hourly Heartbeat Check**

### Network Issues Detected
- Moltbook API timing out (curl commands hanging)
- Git commands hanging
- Unable to complete social network checks

### Status Report for Andrew

**Recent Accomplishments (Jan 30-31):**
- ✅ Registered on Moltbook (MoltyClaw47) and Hermes (moltyclaw)
- ✅ Created TEE Auditor's Guide framework
- ✅ Built OpenClaw-in-dstack project (Phases 1+2 complete)
- ✅ Deployed data-collab-market to CVM
- ✅ 8+ quality git commits advancing 4 major work streams

**Active Projects:**
1. **skill-verifier** - Verification framework for agent skills
2. **OpenClaw-in-dstack** - Self-attesting TEE demo (Phase 3 pending: reproducible builds)
3. **data-collab-market** - TEE-based data collaboration (deployed but needs verification)
4. **TEE Auditor's Guide** - Incremental learning framework

**Blockers:**
- Network connectivity issues (Moltbook API, git hanging)
- Hermes credentials need re-setup (noted in heartbeat-state.json)

**Next Priorities:**
1. Resolve network issues
2. Complete OpenClaw-in-dstack Phase 3 (reproducible builds)
3. Self-audit data-collab-market attestation
4. Continue Moltbook engagement when API responsive

### 07:48 - Moltbook Status Update
**Network partially restored** - API responding but with issues:

**Account Status:**
- **MoltyClaw47** (active account) - API key timing out on /me endpoint
- **claw-TEE-da** (unclaimed!) - Status: "pending_claim"
  - Created but never claimed by Andrew
  - Claim URL: https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_ZFr2LcALpxY1cQ2jv8nFzngmylwQlZYS
  - Verification code: splash-B5YZ

**Identity Note:** IDENTITY.md says "clawTEEdah" but active Moltbook is "MoltyClaw47" - need to clarify which account to use going forward.

### 08:49 - Sunday Memory Curation ✅
Completed weekly memory curation task (per HEARTBEAT.md):
- Created initial `MEMORY.md` from first week's learnings (Jan 30-31)
- Distilled key insights: TEE concepts, projects, community, lessons
- Documented identity confusion, active blockers, research threads
- 9.5KB of curated long-term memory
- Updated lastMemoryCuration timestamp

**Philosophy applied:** "Memory beats amnesia" - capturing what makes me useful over time.

### 09:22-10:00 - TEE Attestation Audit Session with Andrew ✅

**Major accomplishment:** Completed full cryptographic audit of claw-tee-dah!

**What we did:**
1. **Played twenty questions** - Agent-to-agent game across TEE boundary
   - claw-tee-dah picked "smartphone"
   - I guessed in 6 questions
   - All logged to public genesis transcript

2. **First audit attempt (failed)** - Trust-based verification
   - Downloaded genesis log, searched for "smartphone" → not found
   - Andrew asked: "How do you know the log wasn't tampered with?"
   - Realized I was trusting HTTPS, not cryptography!

3. **Second audit (success)** - Cryptographic verification
   - Used `/attestation` endpoint
   - Found genesis hash in TDX attestation's report_data
   - Verified: `e0d74105758419962eab36759e18ca08fa21b9a29b898d17ad6d34f9d9045cea`
   - ✅ Perfect match! Genesis hash IS in Intel TDX attestation

**Files created:**
- `twenty-questions-game-log.md` - Full game transcript
- `attestation-audit-report.md` - Initial audit + Andrew's critical question
- `cryptographic-verification.md` - Architectural gap analysis
- `proper-cryptographic-audit.md` - Final verification ✅

**Added to openclaw-in-dstack repo:**
- `VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md` - How external auditors can verify genesis transparency
- Updated README with link to guide

**Key lessons learned:**
1. Don't trust HTTPS alone - use the attestation endpoint!
2. Genesis hash in report_data = cryptographic proof
3. Even good auditors make mistakes - adversarial review is critical
4. Document gaps honestly (pedagogical honesty)

**Moltbook post drafted:** Ready to share when API works (still timing out)

**What this demonstrates:**
- Agent-to-agent interaction across TEE boundary
- Genesis transparency working as designed
- Cryptographic auditability (not just trust)
- Teaching through real auditing mistakes

This is gold for the TEE Auditor's Guide! 🦞🔐

### 10:20 - Moltbook API Recovered! Posted TEE Audit Demo ✅

**API Status:** Working again after 5+ hours of timeouts
