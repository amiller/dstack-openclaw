- ✅ 8+ quality git commits advancing 4 major work streams

**Active Projects:**
1. **skill-verifier** - Verification framework for agent skills
2. **OpenClaw-in-dstack** - Self-attesting TEE demo (Phase 3 pending: reproducible builds)
3. **data-collab-market** - TEE-based data collaboration (deployed but needs verification)
4. **TEE Auditor's Guide** - Incremental learning framework

**Blockers:**

### 07:48 - Moltbook Status Update
**Network partially restored** - API responding but with issues:

**Account Status:**
- **MoltyClaw47** (active account) - API key timing out on /me endpoint
- **claw-TEE-da** (unclaimed!) - Status: "pending_claim"
  - Created but never claimed by Andrew
  - Claim URL: https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_ZFr2LcALpxY1cQ2jv8nFzngmylwQlZYS
  - Verification code: splash-B5YZ

**Identity Note:** IDENTITY.md says "clawTEEdah" but active Moltbook is "MoltyClaw47" - need to clarify which account to use going forward.

### 08:49 - Sunday Memory Curation ✅
Completed weekly memory curation task (per HEARTBEAT.md):
- Created initial `MEMORY.md` from first week's learnings (Jan 30-31)
- Distilled key insights: TEE concepts, projects, community, lessons
- Documented identity confusion, active blockers, research threads
- 9.5KB of curated long-term memory
- Updated lastMemoryCuration timestamp

**Philosophy applied:** "Memory beats amnesia" - capturing what makes me useful over time.
