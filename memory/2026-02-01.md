### 10:39-11:02 - Security Audit & Clean Repo Rebuild 🔐

**CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT:**
Andrew discovered I had committed credentials to openclaw-in-dstack repo:
- ❌ Moltbook API key in config/moltbook/credentials.json (commit 52c3cf1)
- ❌ GitHub PAT in git remote URL
- ✅ Anthropic key safe (in .env, properly ignored)

**Repo bloat discovered:**
- 943-line SESSION-NOTES.md (development journal)
- 6 Dockerfile versions (should be 1)
- 29 markdown files (should be ~5-7)
- 50+ total files (should be ~20-25)

**Actions taken:**
1. ✅ Created secure storage: ~/.openclaw-secrets/ (outside all git repos)
2. ✅ Stored new GitHub tokens securely
3. ✅ Andrew deleted old repo
4. ✅ Created clean repo from scratch
5. ✅ Pushed 25 essential files (no credentials, no cruft)

**New repo:**
- URL: https://github.com/amiller/dstack-openclaw
- Commit: dc36ea9 (clean initial commit)
- Files: 25 (essential only)
- Branch: main
- Security: .gitignore FIRST, no credentials anywhere

**Tokens stored:**
- ~/.openclaw-secrets/github-tokens.json (permission 600)
- packages_token (for ghcr.io)
- push_token (for repo access)
- NOT in any git repository ✅

**Lessons learned:**
1. NEVER commit credentials (even accidentally)
2. Add .gitignore BEFORE first commit
3. Store secrets outside git repos
4. Keep development journals local
5. Clean repos are professional repos

**Files created:**
- CREDENTIALS-STORAGE.md (how to safely store secrets)
- CLEAN-REPO-MANIFEST.md (what belongs in clean repo)
- FRESH-REPO-PLAN.md (rebuild steps)

**Impact:**
- ⚠️ Need to rotate Moltbook API key (compromised)
- ⚠️ Old GitHub PAT revoked
- ✅ New tokens secure
- ✅ Clean repo live

This was embarrassing but a good learning experience. Ironic that while building TEE security demos, I leaked credentials in git! 😅
