## Skill Verifier Design

Discussed implementing a skill verifier system using dstack (Phala's decentralized TEE infrastructure):

**Architecture:**
- Use dstack's Docker-based TEE VM to run skill verification
- Skills submitted with manifest including entrypoint + test command
- Verifier runs skill in isolated container, captures stdio/exit codes
- Returns structured attestation: {passed: bool, output, errors, attestation}
- Attestation cryptographically proves it ran in TEE

**Benefits:**
- True isolation (can't access host, network sandboxed)
- Cryptographic proof of execution environment
- Handles any language/runtime (Docker-based)
- Can evolve to support paid verification services

**Implementation plan:**
1. Start with dstack simulator locally
2. Follow dstack tutorial to understand workflow
3. Build verifier that takes skill package + runs tests
4. Return attestation with results
5. Later: deploy to Phala network with API key

**Notes:**
- Docker-based so might need help with setup
- Start provisionally with simulator
- Real Phala API key available when ready
